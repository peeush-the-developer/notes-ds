## Population vs Sample

| Population                                                                         | Sample                                 |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| It includes all subjects possessing a common characteristic that is being studied. | It is a subset of population.          |
| Parameters                                                                         | Statistics                             |
| Represented using Greek letters (mu, sigma)                                        | Represented using Roman letters (x, s) |
| Usually large and almost impossible to collect data for each object.               | Usually small.                         |

_We compute Statistics, and use them to estimate parameters._
_The computation is the first part of Statistics (Descriptive Statistics), and the estimation is the second part (Inferential Statistics)._

## Levels of Measurement

- There are 4 type of Levels: _Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio_ levels.
- Data is classified according to the highest level which it fits.
- _Nominal_ is the lowest levels. Only names are meaningful here.
- _Ordinal_ adds an order to the names.
- _Interval_ adds meaningful differences.
- _Ratio_ adds a zero so that ratios are meaningful.

## Types of Sampling

There are 5 types of Sampling:

- _Random Sampling_
- _Systematic Sampling_
- _Convenience Sampling_
- _Cluster Sampling_
- _Stratified Sampling_
