# Basic definitions

**Statistics:** It is a collection of methods for planning experiments, obtaining data, and then organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions.

**Variable:** It is a characteristic or attribute that can assume different values.

**Random variable:** It is a variable whose values are determined by chance.

**Population:** All subjects possessing a common characteristic that is being studied.

**Sample:** It is a subset of the population.

**Parameter:** It is a characteristic or measure obtained from a population.

**Statistic:** It is a characteristic or measure obtained from a sample. _Not to be confused with Statistics_

**Descriptive statistics:** It is a collection, organization, summarization and presentation of the data.

**Inferential statistics:** It is generalizing from samples to populations using probabilities. Performing Hypothesis Testing, determining relationships between variables, and making predictions.

**Qualitative variables:** Variables which assume non-numerical values. Ex: Type of person -> Man, woman; Indian Seasons -> Summer, autumn, winter, Spring; etc.

**Quantitative variables:** Variables which assume numerical values. Ex: Temperature during the day, stock prices of company day by day, etc.

**Discrete variables:** Variables which assume a finite or countable number of possible values. Usually obtained by counting.

**Continuous variables:** Variables which assume an infinite number of possible values. Usually obtained by measurement.

**Nominal Level:** It is a level of measurement which classifies data into mutually exclusive, all inclusive categories in which no order or ranking can be imposed on the data.

**Ordinal Level:** It is a level of measurement which classifies the data into categories that can be ranked. Differences between the ranks do not exist.

**Interval Level:** It is a level of measurement which classifies the data that can be ranked and differences are meaningful. However there is no meaningful zero, so ratios are meaningless.

**Ratio Level:** It is a level of measurement which classifies the data that can be ranked, differences are meaningful, and there is a true zero. True ratios exists between the different units of measure.

**Random sampling:** It is a sampling in which the data is collected using chance methods or random numbers.

**Systematic sampling:** It is a sampling in which data in obtained by seleting every kth object.

**Convenience sampling:** It is a sampling in which data is readily available is used.

**Stratified sampling:** It is a sampling in which data is divided into groups (called _Strata_) according to some characteristic. Each of these strata is then sampled using one of the other sampling techniques.

**Cluster sampling:** It is a sampling in which the population is divided into groups (usually geographically). Some of these groups are randomly selected and then all of the elements in those groups are selected.
