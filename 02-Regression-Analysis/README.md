## R-squared vs Adjusted R-Squared

**R-Squared** is the total variation in target variable that can be explained by the model (independent variables).
Formulae:
TSS = \sum{y - y_bar}**2 y_bar is the mean of target variable
RSS = \sum{y - y_pred}**2 y_pred is the predicted value for target variable
R^2 = 1 - RSS/TSS

**Adjusted R-Squared**
